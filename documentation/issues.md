# Turnarchist Notes

- Misread what tile was below me - thought I was 1 away when I was 2 away
- Accidentally using spear when trying to move
  - visualize attack range
- Multiple wizards being unclear, not sure what attack is coming from which
  - Maybe the tiles should have some beam that connects them to the wizard + different colors
- Hit warnings don’t show up when you enter a room on the first turn a monster wakes up
- Hit warnings stay around after you kill something (a wizard for instance)
- Coins cover up hit warning
  - adjust coin rendering
- Button to switch weapons quickly + HUD shows equipped weapon?

- Inventory management is kind of a pain sometimes, dropping the right items and picking up items (may be a non issue)
  - lean towards non issue
- Vending machine should maybe drop items on your square instead of randomly?
  - yes, basically push to inventory unless full and then drop on floor
- Equipping/unequipping lantern does not update lighting
  - oh yeah lanterns are super broken
- Also small note the "your weapon fails to damage the rock" still comes up with pickaxe and spellbook

**Weird edge case**: A mob seemed to do 2 damage in one turn? Either that or player was already at 1 health but didn’t realize it somehow. Maybe we need to make the health more obvious somehow.

**Idea**: Player sprite changes based on health, sorta like mushrooms in Mario
